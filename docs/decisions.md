## G2 — Compliance definition (2026-10-16)

**Question.** How should the simulation define generalized compliance G?

**Options** (drafted by Claude; details in `paper_notes.md` §1):
1. Use the paper's definition exactly: Eq. 3 sets the commanded left and right
   cable lengths from (α, G, A, l0). Each joint's allowed angle range follows
   from the cable geometry: the joint is free while both cables are slack
   (`paper_notes.md` §1.5, my derivation).
2. Redefine G as an angular slack (e.g. slack = G·A). Simpler, but it is no
   longer the paper's G, so E1 would not be a reproduction.
3. Option 1, plus a geometry-independent report of each G as the angular slack
   it produces.

**Choice.** Option 1 (Fahad).

**Why.** _Draft for Fahad to confirm or rewrite:_ the paper's G is defined
through cable lengths, so implementing it literally is what makes E1 a
reproduction. It also lets implementations A and B share the same Eq. 3, so
the A/B agreement test (G5) compares like with like.

**Consequences / still open.**
- For 0 < G < 0.5, Eq. 3 is applied literally (`paper_notes.md` §1.6). The
  paper never describes this range in words. Fahad has not yet separately
  confirmed this reading.
- l0 must be re-derived for this robot's cable geometry, so that
  l0 ≥ max|d𝓛/dα| (`paper_notes.md` §1.6). This is part of G4.

## Environment notes (not a gate)

- 2026-10-16: ffmpeg installed with Homebrew (`brew install ffmpeg`) on
  Fahad's Mac. It is not pinned in `requirements.txt`; the README lists it
  as a setup step.
